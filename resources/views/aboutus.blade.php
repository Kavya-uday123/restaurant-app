            <h5>Our Vision</h5><br>
            When everyday people sort through all the ‘spin’ there is one quick-service restaurant that is ‘A Cut Above’… that’s Wendy’s … we stand for honest food … higher quality, fresh, wholesome food … prepared when you order it … prepared by Wendy’s kind of people … people that believe this is My Wendy’s … we do it Dave’s Way … we don’t cut corners.<br>

            <h5>Our Values</h5><br>
            QUALITY IS OUR RECIPE<br>
            DO THE RIGHT THING<br>
            TREAT PEOPLE WITH RESPECT<br>
            PROFIT MEANS GROWTH<br>
            GIVE SOMETHING BACK<br>
            <br>
            The foundation of Wendy’s long-term success includes core values that we embrace every day in our restaurants and restaurant support centers around the world.
             
            Wendy’s core values, including “Quality is our Recipe,” “Do the Right Thing” and “Give Something Back,” were created by our founder Dave Thomas more than 40 years ago. They are timeless guideposts for our employees and franchisees.
             
            Consistent with these values, we believe it is our responsibility to our stakeholders to focus on Wendy’s business success, while at the same time caring for our customers, employees, communities and the world around us.<br>
